### Problems
Focus on directed graphs and their parts:
* [`/src/acyclicity/Acyclicity.java`](src/acyclicity/Acyclicity.java): Problem 1, Checking Consistency of CS Curriculum, performs a consistency check of the curriculum, that is, checks that there are no cyclic dependencie;
* [`/src/toposort/Toposort.java`](src/toposort/Toposort.java): Problem 2, Determining an Order of Courses, finds an order of all courses that is consistent with all dependencies;
* [`/src/strongly_connected/StronglyConnected.java`](src/strongly_connected/StronglyConnected.java): Advanced Problem 3, Checking Whether Any Intersection in a City is Reachable from Any Other, checks whether it is still possible to drive legally from any intersection to any other intersection.
